## WaterFramesBackported

A rewrite for forge 1.7.10 of a nice mod WATERFrAMES (source at: [https://github.com/SrRapero720/waterframes](https://github.com/SrRapero720/waterframes))

### Dependencies

- [WATERMeDIA](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/watermedia): Multimedia Support

    Take latest version (recommended 2.1.24), and it does not matter that the mod is for 1.21.+
- JNA

    This library is now bundled with the mod. Please remove ``jna-5.10.0.jar`` and
    ``jna-platform-5.10.0.jar`` if you have placed them in your ``mods`` folder.
    The mod will now extract a ``waterframes-jna-5.10.0.jar`` into the ``mods`` folder.

### More info about the 1.7.10 port

- The mod uses WATERMeDIA that was developed for 1.21.1. That means some features might be broken.
- Redstone control is not supported yet.
- Displays can show camera view from Security Craft if LookingGlass is installed. To use this feature
  set ``camera://x,y,z`` where x, y and z are camera coordinates.
- OpenComputers integration is present. You can set URL and other parameters with computers.
- Other features might not be ported from WATERFrAMES.
- Will be (if my free time allows it) synchronised with my 1.12.2 port
  - First two numbers of the mod version indicate minecraft-version-agnostic versions of the mod.
  - Third number of the mod version indicate specific minecraft version patch (improvements, fixes).

If you are experiencing crashes, feel free to open issues [here](https://github.com/Toshayo/WaterFrames/issues) I'll fix when I have time.

**Please don't report issues directly to WATERMeDIA or original WATERFrAMES mod!**
