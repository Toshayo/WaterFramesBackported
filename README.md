## WaterFramesBackported

A rewrite for forge 1.12.2 of a nice mod WATERFrAMES (source at: [https://github.com/SrRapero720/waterframes](https://github.com/SrRapero720/waterframes))

### Dependencies

- [WATERMeDIA](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/watermedia): Multimedia Support

    Take latest version (recommended 2.1.25), and it does not matter that the mod is for 1.21.+

### Credits

- [SrRapero720](https://github.com/SrRapero720): Original author of the mod
- [FabiAcr](https://www.twitch.tv/fabi_acr): Author of the WATERFrAMES block models
- **Kotyarendj**: Author of the current WATERFrAMES block textures
- **[AzzyDR](https://github.com/AzzyDR)**: Mod tester


### More info about the 1.12.2 port

- The mod uses WATERMeDIA that was developed for 1.21.1. That means some features might be broken.
- Redstone control is not supported yet.
- OpenComputers integration is present. You can set URL and other parameters with computers.
- Other features might not be ported from WATERFrAMES.
- Will be (if my free time allows it) synchronised with my 1.7.10 port

If you are experiencing crashes, feel free to open issues [here](https://github.com/Toshayo/WaterFrames/issues) I'll fix when I have time.

**Please don't report issues directly to WATERMeDIA or original WATERFrAMES mod!**
