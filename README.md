## WaterFramesBackported

A rewrite for forge 1.7.10 of a nice mod WATERFrAMES (source at: [https://github.com/SrRapero720/waterframes](https://github.com/SrRapero720/waterframes))

### Dependencies

- [WATERMeDIA](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/watermedia): Multimedia Support

    Take latest version, and it does not matter that the mod is for 1.21.1
- JNA

    You will need jna and jna-platform libraries (5.10.0 for example). If you have a recent minecraft installation
    you can find these in some libraries' folder. (These might probably be included in mod jar in newer version of the mod)
    
    It should be installed in ``mods`` folder like any other mod (though the game will probably warn you that it's not a mod)

### Credits

### More info about the 1.7.10 port

- The mod uses WATERMeDIA that was developed for 1.21.1. That means some features might be broken.
- Redstone control is not supported yet.
- Other features might not be ported from WATERFrAMES.

If you are experiencing crashes, feel free to open issues [here](https://github.com/Toshayo/WaterFrames/issues) I'll fix when I have time.

**Please don't report issues directly to WATERMeDIA or original WATERFrAMES mod!**
